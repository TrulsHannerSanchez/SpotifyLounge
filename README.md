# SpotifyLounge
A Spotify queuer for multiple people - perfect for a house party, gathering or event.

## Description
Sharing is caring, as they say. And as such we want to make it even easier to share music across multiple people and devices. The Spotify Lounge application is attempting to create a virtual space where multiple people can join in, add music to a queue and the music will then proceed to be played for all of the people within the Lounge through their Spotify device of choice.

## Technology
This project communicates with the Spotify API and is built using:
- Angular for our client-side web application
- .NET Core for our API, business logic and data management

## Getting Started
Anyone is welcome to join in on the collaboration of this application, however, it does require some prerequisites. We recommend that you have Visual Studio 2017 installed with the Web Development workload in order to have all of the needed information to be able to work on and develop this application.

Once you have that feel free to clone the repository and open it in Visual Studio. Please create a configuration file for each environment as such: applicationsettings.development.secret.json. These configuration files are ignored by git and as such allows us to store our own information which the application requires. Examples of this includes Spotify Credentials for our application.
